One last thing that I take away from this year is that many of the problems are not what
they appear to be. As an example, the dominoes of [Day 24](/aoc/{% post_url 2017-12-24-electromagnetic-moat %})
are really only the edges of a graph.

My approach has been the greedy one of waking up (not at the exact time the problem is published, so leaderboards were
a no-go), reading the problem and then going straight to trying to solving it in the first way I could think of.
This meant that I usually didn't think of what the problem actually generalized to but instead solved
it on intuition.

In some cases, this made no difference as the solution I wrote was essentially how you would solve
the more general problems. In other cases however it would have been better to take a step back and
think more about the data structures and algorithms that would apply, as many of them are ones I have
experienced in courses or earlier programming endeavours. This time would be an initial investment that
I think would quickly start paying dividends. During AoC 2018 I will try to be mindful of this.
